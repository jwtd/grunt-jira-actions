### Requirements

* Grunt `>=0.4.0`
* API access to a Jira instance

### Installation

I bet you were expecting me to to tell you that if you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, to be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, because it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins.

Well, I'm not going to do that. Instead, I'm going to assume you are familiar with that process, and will skip ahead to explaining how you can install this plugin. You do so with this command:

```shell
npm install grunt-jira-actions --save-dev
```

Once the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-jira-actions');
```

# Performing Actions in Jira

## <a name="setJiraConfig"></a>Specify Jira Connection Properties

The following options are used by all Jira Action tasks:

- `env_var_for_jira_username` - Environment variable that holds Jira username. Default is 'JIRA_UN'.
- `env_var_for_jira_password` - Environment variable that holds Jira password. Default is 'JIRA_PW'.
- `jira_host` - Base domain of your Jira instance's api root (i.e. 'foo.atlassian.net').
- `jira_protocol` - The protocol which Jira's api uses for connections. Default is 'https'.
- `jira_port` - The port on which Jira's api allows connections on. Default is 443.
- `jira_api_version` - The version of Jira's api to target. Default is '2'.

These values can be set:
* Globaly using the `setJiraConfig` task
* In each task's top level options collection (will override global values)
* In each target's option collection (will override task and global values)

### Example

```js

module.exports = function(grunt) {

  grunt.initConfig({

    // These values will be the defaults used in all Jira action tasks and targets
    setJiraConfig: {
      options: {
        env_var_for_jira_username: 'JIRA_UN',
        env_var_for_jira_password: 'JIRA_PW',
        jira_host: 'foo.atlassian.net',
        jira_protocol: 'https',
        jira_port: 443,
        jira_api_version: '2'
      }
    },

    // Multi-task for creating Jira stories
    createJiraIssue: {

      // Override global Jira config options with task specific options
      options: {
        env_var_for_jira_username: 'BAR_JIRA_UN',
        env_var_for_jira_password: 'BAR_JIRA_PW',
        jira_host: 'bar.atlassian.net',
        jira_protocol: 'http',
        jira_port: 80,
        jira_api_version: '2'
      },

      // Override global and task specific Jira config options with target specific options
      createFooStory: {
        options: {
          env_var_for_jira_username: 'BAZ_JIRA_UN',
          env_var_for_jira_password: 'BAZ_JIRA_PW',
          jira_host: 'baz.atlassian.net',
          jira_protocol: 'http',
          jira_port: 80,
          jira_api_version: '2'
        }
      }

    }

    // Load the task
    grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-jira-actions');

    // Call setJiraConfig, before any other Jira action tasks
    grunt.registerTask('default', ['setJiraConfig', 'createJiraIssue:createFooStory']);

  });
}

```

Within that section, you can create any number of targets that can be used to submit different JQL queries. Place common values in the top level options collection. Place target specific values in their respective target's option's collections.

Each target within this task will save its results `grunt.config` with the variable `this.target + 'search_results` as a hash of issues with the issue key as the hash key.

- `search_string` - A valid JQL search string.
- `start_at` - Optional page offset for the search. Default is 0.
- `max_results` - Optional max limit of issues. Default is 9999.

```js

grunt.initConfig({

    // Search Jira for specific issues
    searchJira: {

      // Declare options that are common to all Jira actions
      options: {
        jira_host: 'foo.atlassian.net'
      },

      // Create specific targets for different Jira searches
      // This target's search results can be accessed via grunt.config('forGenStoriesAndBugs.search_results');
      forGenStoriesAndBugs: {
        options: {
          search_string: 'project="GEN" AND status="OPEN" AND issuetype in ("Bug","Story")',
          //start_at: 0,
          //max_results: 3,
        }
      }

      // Add another JQL search
      // This target's search results can be accessed via grunt.config('forGenEpics.search_results');
      forGenEpics: {
        options: {
          search_string: 'project="GEN" issuetype in ("Epic")',
        }
      }

    }

});

```


### JQL Search Results

The results hash contains the issue id, key, summary, status id, and status label.

```

{
  'GEN-1':
   { id: '10221',
     key: 'GEN-1',
     summary: 'Issue summary foo',
     status_id: '1',
     status: 'Open' },
  'GEN-2':
   { id: '13897',
     key: 'GEN-2',
     summary: 'Issue summary bar',
     status_id: '1',
     status: 'Open' },
  'GEN-3':
   { id: '17429',
     key: 'GEN-3',
     summary: 'Issue summary baz',
     status_id: '1',
     status: 'Open' }
}

```

## Experimental : jiraProjectRapidView

```js

grunt.initConfig({

    // Get a Jira project's rapid view
    jiraProjectRapidView: {

      // Declare options that are common to all Jira actions
      options: {
        jira_host: 'foo.atlassian.net'
      },

      // Create specific targets for different Jira searches
      ofGeneralProject: {
        options: {
          project_key: 'GEN'
        }
      }

    }
